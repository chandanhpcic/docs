Relations with Reticen8
-----------------------
Reticen8 is built on top of FreeBSD. The aim of the Reticen8 team is to stay as
close to the original source as possible. Reticen8 can be installed on
a standard FreeBSD installation, this way a hosted system can be converted
easily to run Reticen8. A bootstrap script is available to make the installation
process a joyful experience.

  To convert your FreeBSD hosted installation to Reticen8, see the Reticen8
  bootstrap script on `Reticen8's update tools @ github <https://github.com/reticen8/update/>`__
