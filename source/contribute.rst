Testing
-------
Contribute by testing the latest development version to make the next release even
better than the last. If you like to test a development version then the easiest
way is to login to the console and type:

::

  pkg install -y reticen8-devel


And to revert back to the production version:

::

  pkg install -y reticen8


That is all there is to it to test the latest development release.
Development releases are usually built at the same day the latest production
release comes available.

Issues can be easily reported on github, please consider carefully if the issue
could be a configuration or user error before reporting it. If you are unsure,
